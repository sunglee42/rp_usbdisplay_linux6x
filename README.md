# RoboPeak/DFRobot 2.8" USB TFT Driver

This repository is made for Linux 6.x,I don't know if it work on older version(likes 5.x).  
only knows 6.x has changed for framebuffer things and this source can work on it.

as you know, the old repository(pimoroni or robopeak) can't work anymore.  
so I modified and cleaned pimoroni's version using AI, now it can work on 6.x.
